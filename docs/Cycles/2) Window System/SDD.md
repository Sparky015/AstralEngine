# Software Design Document

## 1. Introduction
> This section provides the purpose of the document. It gives an overview of the project. It defines the scope and
> goals of the project. It lists any definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations used throughout the document.

## 2. System Overview
> This section includes a high-level architecture diagram. It describes the system context and boundaries. It outlines
> the major components and their responsibilities.

## 3. System Architecture
> This section covers the architecture style (e.g., client-server, microservices, etc.). It explains the architectural
> patterns and principles used. It describes the architecture layers and tiers. It provides a component diagram and
> descriptions of each component.

## 4. System Design

> This section discusses the module decomposition and organization. It specifies the module interfaces (e.g., APIs,
> contracts). It includes module interaction diagrams. It provides data flow diagrams.

### 4.2 Database Design
> This section presents the data models (e.g., entity-relationship diagrams). It documents the database schemas. It
> outlines the data storage and persistence strategy.

### 4.3 User Interface Design
> This section contains user interface mockups and wireframes. It describes the UI component hierarchy and navigation
> flow. It explains the UI design patterns and guidelines.
