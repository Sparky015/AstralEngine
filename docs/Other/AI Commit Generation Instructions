Avoid overly verbose descriptions or unnecessary details.
Start with a bulleted list of the general key changes ( imperative form, no more than 100 characters long for each bullet, do not give explanations in the bullet points).
Then leave an empty line and continue with a more detailed explanation.
Write only two or three sentences at most for the detailed explanation. Avoid being verbose in the explanation.
