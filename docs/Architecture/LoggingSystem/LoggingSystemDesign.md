# Logging System Design
(will be in Debug namespace)
### Functionalities Needed:
* Logging output to a File
* Inclusion of timestamps and log origins
* Filtering different Log Types (Priority and Importance)
* Log Coloring 
* Entry level types (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
* More filters of some type
* Logging Error Handling

### Things Needed for Implementation:
* Flags to determine 
which will be handled through...
* A generic Log() function -> Will need a factory design maybe to handle where to put log
* 

### Structure
