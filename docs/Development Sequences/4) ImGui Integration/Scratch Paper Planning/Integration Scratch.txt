    Problems to Solve:

1) Make the ImGui window pop up
2) Feed mouse clicks and key inputs into ImGui





    Part 1:

 - Add a ImGui layer that creates the window


    Part 2:

 - Create an input state and feed the input events to the input state layer
 - Feed the values of the input state to the ImGui Layer
    [ How will ImGui read the Input State? -> Initialize the InputState in the Application class with a getter]
 - ImGui Layer Works!!!

To Do:
Match the key codes of GLFW to a enum of Ayla keycodes
Make a switch case to grab the input event data and change the input state
Store the input state machine in a InputState class as


Keycodes range from a-z, 1-9 + all the shifts, controls, tabs and so on.

ex. AY_a = true


I could type define a struct with the isKeyDown and isRepeating
