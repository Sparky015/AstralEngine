Classes / Functions

/*
* @brief Calculates the position of the tile that the given mouse coordinates are on
* @param x The x mouse coordinate
* @param y The y mouse coordinate
* @return The calculated tile location
*/
MousePosToSquarePos
    Impl Note: Need to check the window width and height when doing calculation each time

/*
* @brief Checks if a mouse coordinate is on the tile
* @param x The x mouse coordinate
* @param y The y mouse coordinate
* @return True or false depending on if the mouse click over a piece on the chess board
*/
IsMouseClickOverPiece
    Impl Note: Need to check with piece data


/*
* @brief Moves a piece to the coordinates of the mouse
* @param pieceID The ID of the piece being moved.

DragPieceToLocation
    Impl Note: Will need ImGui or GLFW to get mouse state
