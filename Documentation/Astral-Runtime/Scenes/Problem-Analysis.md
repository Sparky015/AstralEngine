#### Scenes Problem Analysis

What am I working to fix?



Important: Don't solve problems I don't have. Trying to predict future problems and
trying to solve them just makes more problems and complicates things.

Context:

Why am I solving this problem?


Identify and Balance Constraints:

How much time to I have to make this?


How much research do I have to do on this?


How much memory can this take up?


What is the performance budget?


What is the latency/overhead requirements?


Will this be handled differently in different builds (Debug vs Release vs Dist)?


What are the inputs and the outputs?


Value:

Identify specific, concrete, measurable value.


How much time is this problem worth?


What is the value of solving this problem?


Cost:

What is the cost of solving the problem?


Platform:

How will this handle the platform targets?


How will this interact with shared resources (RAM, SSD)?


Data:

What is read and written over time? What is the access pattern?


When is data accessed statistically relative to other data?


What data values are common? Outliers?
