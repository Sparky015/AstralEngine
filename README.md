## Introduction

What is the problem I am trying to solve with this engine?
- I want to know what a game engine does to accomplish its task
- I want to find out if an engine programmer or graphics programmer role would fit me
- I want to develop my skills in a field that I find interesting and that I might potentially pursue
  - I want to develop my code writing skills, my designing skills, and my problem solving skills
- I want hands-on experience with things that I find interesting and potential career paths
- Apply what had been taught beyond the basic given implementation

Sums up to: exploration, skill development

> ### Why I am building this engine?
> A project to learn and gain experience in working with game engines and C++.
> - Explore Interests and potential careers
> - Learn how game engines work
> - Gain skills in writing code and the development process
> 
>
> 
> ### How I am building this engine? 
> 
> - Watch introduction to a topic
> - Identify the problem
> - Plan and design my solution with all the expectations of the api
> - Watch Cherno's solution he came up with
> - Compare the designs and reflect on the good parts and bad parts of my solution 
> - Reflect on why Cherno did it the way he did over what I did
> - Decide on what pieces to use between the two and implement
> 
> 
> 
> ### Why am I building the engine the way I am? 
>
> - builds a solid foundation
> - I can't solve problems I didn't know were a thing
> - Trying to see common solutions or ways to solve a problem that I didn't know everyone does
> - Helps learn engine basics without wasting time 
> - Helps me get to learning more advanced and niche topics quicker
> - Helps me avoid cementing bad practices in designing and implementations
> - Creditable resources help me learn best practices from people with the experience and knowledge of expectations  (cherno)
> - Allows me to develop an expertise or realm of expertise quicker

## Building the Ayla Engine



> ### Operating System Support
> Ayla supports use on macOS and Windows on 64-bit systems. There are no plans for any operating system 
> outside of that. CMake is used as for the build system to support 
> cross-platform building, which also supports creating project files for IDEs like Visual Studio
> and Xcode.
> 
> Windows:
>1. Download CMake
>2. Download Visual Studio 2022
>3. Run 'GenerateVisualStudioProject.bat' in the root directory of the engine
>4. Open the generated .sln file
>5. Set the platform to x64
>6. Compile and Run through Visual Studio
>
>
> MacOS:
>1. Download CMake
>2. Download Xcode.
>3. Run 'GenerateXcodeProject.sh' in the root directory of the engine
>4. Open the generated .xcodeproj file
>5. Compile and Run through Xcode
