An overview of the Ayla Engine. Covers the purpose and focus of the engine, how to build it, and what the roadmap for
the future is.

## Purpose and Focus of Ayla

A section to answer a few questions that state the purpose and set the focus of the engine.

### Why I am building this engine?
In short, it is a project to learn and gain experience in working with game engines and C++.
 
 More specifically, I am building this engine for four main reasons:
 
 - Firstly, I want to find out how game engines work and why they work
 the way they do, simply because I am curious and because I can. What better way is there to learn about how something 
 works than making it?
 
 - Secondly, I want to explore my interests to see if this type of work would be a career fit for me. Building an engine
 would give me a chance to see the day-to-day work and confirm my interests in engine and graphics programming as
 a career.
 
 - Thirdly, building a game engine will allow me to develop my C++ skills, design skills, and problem-solving skills.
 The scope of a game engine is giant, so I am sure that I will fail a lot before I get the idea of what the right 
 thing to do is. However, failing will allow me to build good coding and design practices, especially in a large codebase. It 
 also gives me some experience in solving actual problems. 
 
 - Fourthly, building my own engine allows me to understand the engine completely and know what everything is and why
 it is the way it is. It lets me customize the engine to my needs and change anything I need to get my desired effect
 or output. I own the engine, so I don't need to rely on third parties to do anything for me.

 
### How I am building this engine?  (Development Process)

---

1. Watch an introduction to the topic.
####
2. Identify and define the problem that the topic solves
####
3. Design a solution to the problem with the solution's constraints and expected inputs and outputs.
####
4. Watch Cherno's solution to the topic.
####
5. Compare the two solutions. Reflect on the differences in the two solutions and note why the designs differ. Also note,
what contributed to Cherno designing his solution the way he did over what I designed.
####
6. Decide if my components of my design is still good in reflection or if components of Cherno's solution is better. Redo the
parts that are not good in reflection.
####
7. Implement the design.

 
 
 ### Why am I building the engine the way I am? (NOT DONE YET, TEMP)

---

 - builds a solid foundation
 - I can't solve problems I didn't know were a thing
 - Trying to see common solutions or ways to solve a problem that I didn't know everyone does
 - Helps learn engine basics without wasting time 
 - Helps me get to learning more advanced and niche topics quicker
 - Helps me avoid cementing bad practices in designing and implementations
 - Creditable resources help me learn best practices from people with the experience and knowledge of expectations
 - Allows me to develop an expertise or realm of expertise quicker

 ### Operating System Support
 Ayla supports use on macOS and Windows. There are no plans for any operating system 
 outside of that. CMake is used as for the build system to support 
 cross-platform building, which also supports creating project files for IDEs like Visual Studio
 and Xcode.

## Roadmap & Vision (NOT DONE YET, TEMP)

 ### Key Features Planned:
 * 




## Important Practices: (NOT DONE YET, TEMP)
 - Apply what has been learned beyond the basic implementation. Change the goal around and mess with the input to get weird outputs.
